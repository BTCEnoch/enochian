The Enochian Angels

    The system of enochian angel magic was dictated by angels to John Dee and Edward Kelley. The protocols of the sessions show a pious scientist who was obsessed by the curiosity of learning as much as possible about the secrets of creation. He tried to reveal these secrets by spiritual means. John Dee had a different approach to the nature and the universe then it is common today. For this learned scholar planets, stars and the earth itself were part of the divine creation, alive and guarded by angels. On the nature of angels I am writing more elaborated in my section on angels. It is vital to understand the nature of angels when practicing angel-magic.

    Usually the actual appearance of the angels was not documented during the sessions. Only within the Heptarchia Mystica you can find descriptions which are kept in the usual style of appearance, angels had in that time. No descriptions are known of the angels of the Great Table or the Ã†thyrs. The Golden Dawn developed a system how the appearance of an angel can be determined, if only his name is known. Today their system is well-known and utilized by many magicians.

    The telesmatic correspondences are useful to determine characteristics and the appearance of unknown beings and angels. Anything you need is the name. The letters of the name are used to find some basic elements to determine the appearance and the characteristics. The actual appearance is of course quite subjective and depends on the magicians imaginative abilities.

Nalvage should serve us here as an example - he has no objections. Nalvage's name has seven letters. N,A,A,V are male and L,G,E female oriented - thus the angel appears male, though his overall expression is also somehow female. Two times an A results in bigger, prominent wings. His skin is dark tainted and a male grace and delicacy. He is fierce, dominant and has a changing, a bit fiery nature. His character is intense with not much indulgence.
