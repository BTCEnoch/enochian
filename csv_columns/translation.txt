She of many repetitions
He to whom truth is relative
He who lives by his name
Servant who speaks truth

She whose shadow heals
He who charts the pulse
He who harvests echoes
She who tends the hidden fire
He who brings labor

He who holds the twin names
He who lifts the veil
He who crowns the unseen
