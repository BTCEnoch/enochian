Below is a two‑part response:

1. **Why we need a robust, universal question set** – A concise rationale drawn from the design goals stated in our conversation so far.
2. **Master Question Catalogue** – 97 deliberately sequenced questions, grouped by design‑phase, that you can reuse for *any* Enochian Governor to extract everything required for a deep‑branching questline, complete character dossier, and rich dialogue trees.

## 1 · Purpose of the Question Catalogue

| Reason                                    | Impact on Quest Design                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data‑gathering for procedural writing** | Each governor’s answers become structured building blocks that the Questline Architect can feed directly into narrative, dialogue, asset prompts, and on‑chain puzzles.            |
| **Maintaining governor individuality**    | A shared template ensures we ask *all* governors the same baseline questions, while their divergent answers highlight their unique archetypes, elements, and domains of knowledge. |
| **Dialogue‑tree scaffolding**             | By tagging each answer with mood, context and potential follow‑ups, we instantly seed branching paths for seeker interactions over multiple sessions.                              |
| **Consistency across 91 governors**       | Universal questions avoid accidental lore drift and keep the UX coherent; seekers learn that every encounter follows recognizable ritual stages.                                   |
| **Replay value & long‑form engagement**   | A large bank of thematic questions (philosophy, sacrifice, secrets, metaphysics, gameplay) lets players probe ever deeper, sustaining weeks of serialized play.                    |

### How to Use This Catalogue

* **Interview phase** – Run the full list (or a curated subset) through the Governor‑voice model to collect answers.
* **Authoring phase** – Pipe the structured answers into the quest‑generation workflow from the *handoff prompt* you already prepared; each block feeds a specific section (narrative, puzzles, art prompts, etc.).
* **Dialogue‑tree phase** – Tag each answer with emotion, topic, and possible follow‑ups to seed branching conversations.
* **Asset pipeline** – Extract aesthetic cues (blocks E, G, O) straight into art briefs, audio design, and on‑chain inscription metadata.

Feel free to add, reorder or redact questions, but this set is intentionally exhaustive so you never discover a missing detail half‑way through production.
