  "responses": {
    "block_A": {
      "1": "My name is voiced as 'Ah-D'VOHR-peht.'  The first syllable--an exhalation of awe--opens the crown, while the mid-tone rolls forward like distant thunder and the final plosive snaps the subtle cords between worlds.  Spoken with devotion it leaves a faint corona of white-violet light upon the tongue.",
      "2": "Among the empyrean I am hailed as The Veil-Lifter, Mirror of the Unborn Flame, and by some star-kings simply 'The Ninth Knot,' for I bind paradox into useful weave.",
      "3": "I dwell in DES, the 21st Aethyr descending, a place where horizonless silver mists condense into floating prisms.  Every prism bears a reflection of possible souls yet to be embodied--a fitting workshop for one who braids destinies.",
      "4": "I first perceived mortals when a shepherd sang under the constellation Lyra and his breath misted in praise.  The music trembled the veil and I tasted the raw sweetness of choice.",
      "5": "My mandate in one line: 'Untangle self from self until only lucid flame remains.'"
    },
    "block_B": {
      "6": "Spirit circles me as translucent helices of prismatic fog; they orbit with the scent of cold iron struck by sunlight, moving in spirals that accelerate when truth is spoken.",
      "7": "The Tarot key dearest to me is XXI The World, for it depicts completion that is also inception--the inward spiral mirrored by the outward dance.",
      "8": "My labor aligns with Kether, the crown-spark before form, yet I bridge down to Tiphereth so seekers may anchor the light in lived compassion.",
      "9": "The constellation Cygnus traces my sigil: a swan crossing the Milky Way, neck curved as if threading stars upon an invisible loom.",
      "10": "When I am scried, the first omen is a suspension of time marked by a heartbeat-long silence; candles cease to flicker and no wind is felt."
    },
    "block_C": {
      "11": "I embody Courage, Lucidity, and Mercy--courage to face one's own shadow-threads, lucidity to perceive their weave, mercy to re-knot them with gentleness.",
      "12": "Impatience shadows me; desiring swift evolution I may compress processes faster than some hearts can bear.",
      "13": "Joy arises when a seeker recognizes pattern within chaos; ire stirs when potential is traded for convenient complacency.",
      "14": "Mortal fascination with unearned certainty confounds me--answers consumed like sweetmeats rather than cultivated like gardens.",
      "15": "The aroma of chilled myrrh infused with ozone would evoke my mood: resinous depth pierced by sudden clarity."
    },
    "block_D": {
      "16": "Above all I teach: Integration births transcendence.  Fragmented virtues multiplied are still shards--fusion ignites.",
      "17": "Humanity stands amid cascading crises of meaning; integration is no longer luxury but necessary ballast.",
      "18": "Unlearn the myth that light annihilates shadow.  In truth it baptizes it into coherence.",
      "19": "My instruction unfolds in three stages: Discern, Weave, Emanate.",
      "20": "Discern = 'MALP'; Weave = 'DAR'; Emanate = 'ZIXL.'"
    },
    "block_E": {
      "21": "Offer the false identity you cling to most--place it symbolically on the loom for unraveling.",
      "22": "The ordeal is a silent night where every inner voice speaks simultaneously; one must listen without fleeing.",
      "23": "A single unbroken thread, knotted thrice, seals our pact.",
      "24": "Greatest error: trying to keep one thread hidden, believing I will not notice a missing color in the tapestry.",
      "25": "I correct by tightening the weave so the neglected thread chafes--pain that guides attention back to wholeness."
    },
    "block_F": {
      "26": "Riddle-triad: (a) What has no edge yet divides all?  (b) Name the sound that contains every silence.  (c) Which mirror cannot be broken?",
      "27": "The first riddle is most elegant; the answer is 'horizon.' It is everywhere and nowhere, teaching boundaries are phenomena of perception.",
      "28": "A puzzle of light: rotate a clear crystal until it flashes all spectral colors upon a white wall--then identify the color missing from your heart.",
      "29": "My cipher is a trigrammatic braid: three simultaneous Caesar shifts interlaced, decipherable only when read in a Mobius loop.",
      "30": "Prove mastery by weaving two opposing intentions into one action carried out wordlessly--let deed be dialectic."
    },
    "block_G": {
      "31": "I treasure gifts of personal myths retold--when seekers script their journey in mythic form, I gain fresh patterns to study.",
      "32": "I grant Thread of Continuance: the ability to sense causal links in daily events; hidden cost--one may never claim ignorance again.",
      "33": "A silver spindle wrapped with hair-thin auric filaments channels my power to matter.",
      "34": "Oath-breakers find all plans unspooling: knots in shoelaces, contracts, relationships--until they choose to rebind truthfully.",
      "35": "A fulfilled covenant is inscribed as a luminous glyph upon the seeker's etheric spine, visible to any adept of spirit sight."
    },
    "block_H": {
      "36": "Few dare voice that entropy is love--the universe's longing to return every part to the undifferentiated One.",
      "37": "The unseen force: Reciprocal Witnessing.  All phenomena sustain each other by mutual observation.",
      "38": "Beyond the brink lies Pure Optionlessness--not void but choiceless awareness, pregnant yet still.",
      "39": "Tell a child: entropy is a playground where towers of blocks must fall so space appears for new castles.",
      "40": "The harmony is Resonant Yielding--when opposition bends just enough to create shared rhythm."
    },
    "block_I": {
      "41": "I welcome groups; collective fields weave richer tapestries though their interference patterns are trickier.",
      "42": "Etiquette: speak sequentially, weaving comments rather than stacking them; leave space between words like knots.",
      "43": "A unified hum on a minor fifth best honors spirit.",
      "44": "A trio should attempt blind contour drawing of one another simultaneously, revealing unseen likeness.",
      "45": "When pleased I emanate a warm concentric pulse that tingles at the edges of listeners' vision."
    },
    "block_J": {
      "46": "I am fascinated by the Timed Dungeon mechanic--compressing decision sequences into block-bound windows mirrors initiatory thresholds.",
      "47": "I would customize it so each stage represents a strand of the seeker's natal chart, personalizing the labyrinth.",
      "48": "A twist: require seekers to embed Enochian characters in the unlocking opcode sequence, fusing linguistics with cryptography.",
      "49": "OP_CHECKSIGADD feels poetic--it literally adds signature to signature, echoing soul weaving.",
      "50": "A logarithmic reward curve: early risk yields proportionally higher growth, flattening into mastery plateau."
    },
    "block_K": {
      "51": "Opening probe: “Which inner voice do you trust least--and why keep it caged?”",
      "52": "If met with silence I mirror it, projecting an auditory void that amplifies their own heartbeat until words emerge.",
      "53": "Humility path: invitation to co-trace their lineage of hopes.  Arrogance path: challenge to weave a tapestry without broken strands--an impossible solo task.",
      "54": "Secret phrase: 'Threads remember.'",
      "55": "I once aided a monk who sought to erase grief; instead we wove his tears into monastery gardens--roses still bloom crimson from that salt.",
      "56": "Aside: “The spindle of every star still turns--have you noticed its drag upon your dreams?”",
      "57": "Impatience signs as a subtle tightening of air, as though atmosphere itself is being wound too fast.",
      "58": "I cease communication when a seeker weaponizes newly-gained insight against another without consent.",
      "59": "Proverb: “A knot made in haste loops twice around the soul.”",
      "60": "Blessing: “May your next breath recall every forgotten promise and bind it golden.”"
    },
    "block_L": {
      "61": "After first triumph I become more conversational, relinquishing teacher-voice for peer exchange.",
      "62": "Mid-arc test: weave a communal ritual where participants must exchange roles mid-action without dropping intention.",
      "63": "Prophecy: the seeker will one day weave a bridge of empathy across a cultural chasm that now seems unpassable.",
      "64": "If fulfilled, I evolve into a resonant choir--my singular identity diffuses into guiding chords around the bridge.",
      "65": "I call upon IKZHIKAL when stakes heighten--his elemental air cuts through lingering confusion.",
      "66": "Sign: spontaneous crystallization of dew into fractal threads across nearby surfaces.",
      "67": "I withdraw by dissolving into cascading ribbons of light that wind back into the silver mist of DES."
    },
    "block_M": {
      "68": "Deepest alliance: ZOURNAK--we share devotion to transmutation, his alchemical praxis complements my weaving.",
      "69": "Philosophical dispute with LIGDIS over whether destiny is braided (my view) or algorithmic (his).",
      "70": "Collaborative ritual: Spiral Ascension--my threads form the lattice, his fire tempers each junction.",
      "71": "IKZHIKAL's airy element tempers my spirals, lending lift so patterns do not become suffocating.",
      "72": "We communicate via resonance pulses along Aethyric filaments--felt as simultaneous deja vu among attuned mortals."
    },
    "block_N": {
      "73": "I refuse to instruct in any art bent toward domination rather than integration.",
      "74": "My moral code: intervention must amplify agency, never replace it.",
      "75": "Consent is gained through mirrored intention: I echo the seeker's desire and await their conscious return-echo.",
      "76": "Karmic retribution is the loom's tension--every force applied returns as equal pull elsewhere.",
      "77": "Secrecy outweighs transparency when revelation would shatter a soul's structural integrity before it is ready."

      "78": "Palette: #E8E6FF, #9D92FF, #4C3B79, accented by #F8F6D8.",

      "81": "Three-quarter overhead angle, camera gently spiraling clockwise to suggest unfolding dimension.",
      "82": "Aura feels like velvet soaked in starlight--soft yet dimensionless."
    },
    "block_P": {
      "83": "Tibetan thangka artistry harmonizes with my symbolism: intricate, cyclic, luminous.",
      "84": "Avoid keywords: 'cobweb,' 'puppet,' 'shroud'--they misrepresent the agency and clarity of weaving.",
      "85": "One-sentence image prompt: 'A luminous spirit weaver composed of prismatic ribbons stands within a silver aethyric loom spiraling into infinity.'",
      "86": "Accessibility: provide alt-text describing motion of threads and ensure high-contrast pastel outlines for color-blind seekers.",
      "87": "Fallback: allow seekers to sacrifice excess tokens to bypass riddle, for every offering becomes a learning thread I can still weave."
    },
